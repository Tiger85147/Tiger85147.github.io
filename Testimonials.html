<span class="review"><br>
If we were to describe in one word, our experience with Ara Consulting, for our son Arjun, it will be <b>‘Transformative’!!</b><br><br>

Our son was keen to go beyond the conventional rat race of JEE etc, but was struggling to figure out the landscape of institutions that would act like a good springboard for his professional career. <br><br>

To address this fundamental need, Ara has a robust process, which begins with a deep understanding of the streams that our son wanted to pursue. It culminated in a shortlist of the best reputed institutions both in India & abroad for the chosen streams. This gave enormous clarity to our son. Then began the process of Profile/CV creation, Essay & Interview preparation. <br><br>

We soon realized that each college has a different operating philosophy, that permeates into their application & admission process. The Ara team understands this very well. Consequently they set a tailored regimen, setting a gruelling pace for our son to build his profile and to prepare for the interviews based on each different college.
Throughout this process, they struck the right balance of encouragement & critique. It helped our son to appreciate his inherent potential and also become aware of his areas of improvement. <br><br>

A disciplined weekly routine with regular touchpoints to track progress was set. Monthly parent meetings helped us keep pace with the entire admission process. This process of Ara which in our opinion is akin to plucking a rough stone and polishing it into a shining gem has yielded results far beyond what we had thought a few months ago. <br><br>

Today our son has got offers from some of the best ranked universities across India, Europe, Canada & Australia. Full credit to Ara Consulting for helping us navigate through a very critical phase of our lives as parents - that of setting our children on the best possible path for their higher education. <br><br>

We hope that many more parents and students are able to benefit from Ara Consulting in their quest for finding a differentiated career path.

<span class="review" style="color: #ffffff"><br>
My experience with Ara was extremely positive and compared to my friends who went to other counsellors, very different too!<br><br> 

Interacting with Ara on a regular basis helped to guide my thoughts. Having participated in a bunch of extracurriculars at school, they helped me choose the right balance to use in my resume. They also were extremely rigorous with my essays and interviews and made sure that the quality never dropped.<br><br>

Those hours they made sure I put in helped me make those split-second decisions during on-the-spot essays and interviews which contributed hugely towards me getting admissions.<br><br>

Their philosophy of doing all the hard work early and then reaping the rewards later made sure that I had all of my admissions before I had even started my pre-boards! Their way of interacting with me and shaping my thought process for my college and work life was brilliant. They made the very daunting college admissions process look like a breeze! In hindsight, it was the perfect decision to choose Ara.

“…we came across many Admissions consultants/counselors…most of them more or less offered the same services… which lacked personal touch which we think is very crucial...
<br><br>
As parents, we highly recommend Ara because they don’t just deal with counseling, form filling and timely submissions… 

<!--<font color=#ffffff>--> their personalized and intensive coaching<!--</font>-->
for our daughter Kashmira 
<!--<font color=#ffffff>--> on critical skills such as Writing and Interview Preparation<!--</font>-->

made their services stand out…

<br><br>

<!--<font color=#ffffff>-->
Ara helped Kashmira’s transition to become a strong story-teller through her essays and a confident interviewee…

Another positive with Ara has been their pre-emptive and prompt end-to-end services… There was never a need to follow-up with them…

Ara made Kashmira’s Admissions process easy, hassle-free and enjoyable…”

“…the college admission process is arduous. It involves selecting the right universities, years of profile building, financial considerations, essay writing, articulation of extra-curriculars and the like. A professional Counselor makes this roller coaster ride smooth and easy.<br><br>



<!--<font color=#ed5f2f>-->
Ara has guided me and my family through every step of this journey. With their support, my son Arnav gained acceptance from 10+ global universities such as UMass Amherst, HKUST, University of Manchester, University of Toronto and University of Waterloo.<br><br>
<!--</font>-->

<!--<font color=#000000>-->
Although most counselors consider the ‘process’ to be over at that point,
<!--</font>-->

<!--<font color=#ed5f2f>--> Ara coached us on factors to consider while accepting an admission, thus choose between colleges.
Ara has played an instrumental role in my son’s admissions and guided us through every step of the extremely complicated process…”

<span class="review"><br>

We were introduced to Ara Consulting by a reference in 2020. Although they were not many years in the field of counselling, speaking with them instilled confidence in us that we have our child’s interest and career in safe hands.
<br><br>

Ara has been there with us since day one and hand held us through the entire process of submission of forms/preparation of interviews/guiding in essays writing and other minute details. Oftentimes, they have been more concerned about the admissions process than us!
<br><br>

In fact, we have developed a strong personal bond with the founders of Ara, who are more friends than Counsellors now!
